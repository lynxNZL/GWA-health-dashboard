Galaxy Watch Active health dashboard watchface copycat for those without access to the new One UI faces yet. 

This was made in Galaxy Watch Designer so some compromises had to be made.  

Changes will probably be updated here...

NOTE:
You'll need to get Galaxy Watch Designer setup to use this watchface.

I might try and figure out how to get it onto the Galaxy Store if people would prefer.
