## Description:
- Repo for a custom watch faces for Samsung Galaxy Watch.
- **You'll need to get Galaxy Watch Designer set up to install these watchfaces.**
- I sumitted a request to upload faces to the Galaxy Store, pending approval.

## GWA Dashboard:
- Cloned for those without access to the new One UI faces yet
- This was made in Galaxy Watch Designer so some compromises had to be made
- You can tap most buttons for extra features.
- Double tap the AM/PM to hide
- Double tap the time "dots (:)" to hide
